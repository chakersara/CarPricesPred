I have owned this car for over 30 Years.  Is a California car, and have only light rust in it.  It is not fully restored, but has been kept indoors, under cover, and well maintained during this period.  The top, upholstery, and black paint were redone by the previous owner.  In the last few years I have done several upgrades.  About 5 layers of paint and varnish were stripped off the wheels and they were repainted.  The pinstriping on the body and wheels are similar to what was on the car when I got it.  The carburetor, fuel pump and distributor have been gone through.  New spark plugs and plug wires were installed.  The steering box was gone through.  The fuel gauge was replaced, and much of the wiring replaced.  The lights, horn and speedometer work.  Oil was changed recently, and engine and radiator was flushed.  The tires are quite old, but are in good condition.  Transmission and rear end lubricants were replaced.  The car starts easily, and runs strong.  I have included a few spare parts such as distributor cap and water pump packing.  The Graham-Paige legacy book, the Paige Detroit reference and owner's manual book, and several ads and other literature is also included.  This is a very rare car, and even Barrett-Jackson does not know exactly what it is worth.  This would be a good starter car for a complete restoration.   Paige was a popular brand in the 1920s.  They had 4 plants back then, 3 in the US and 1 in Canada.",,wy,41.1836,-104.8023,2021-04-05T12:31:46-0600
